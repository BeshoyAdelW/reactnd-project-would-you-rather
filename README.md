# "Would you rather" app

## Project:

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you can play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

You will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

This app was built as a  project for the Udacity React Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of how Redux works in a React-based web app.

For reference, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
